# Teaching Statistics and Data Science Using R and RStudio Workshop (SSC, June, 2018)

## Overview

#### Workshop on Teaching Modern Statistics and Data Science using R/RStudio 
#### Nicholas Horton, Amherst College

R is a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics that has become popular in academia and in many industries. RStudio is a power interactive development environment (IDE) for R that can be access from the cloud.  This workshop will introduce participants to teaching applied statistics and data science courses using computing in an integrated way. The presenter has been using R and RStudio to teach statistics to undergraduates at all levels for the last decade and will share his approach and favorite examples. Topics will include workflow in the RStudio environment, providing novices with a powerful but manageable set of tools, simple data wrangling, data visualization, and basic statistical inference using R. 

Much of this "Less Volume, More Creativity" approach will be facilitated using the mosaic package. The workshop is designed to be accessible to those with little or no experience with R and is intended to provide participants with skills, examples, and resources that they can use in their own teaching.

## Logistics

### Laptops

You'll be working on your own laptops: please be sure to bring one and a power cord (we'll want to ensure that every pair of participants has a working laptop).

### Shared RStudio server

Registrants will access workshop materials using a shared space on RStudio.cloud.  Please be sure to set up an account prior to the workshop.
