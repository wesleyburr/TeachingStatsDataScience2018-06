## Why the tidyverse?

See http://sas-and-r.blogspot.com/2017/07/options-for-teaching-r-to-beginners.html

and http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/

- Every step solves an immediate problem

- Every step teaches a function that can be used on a variety of datasets

- It gives a taste of real exploratory data analysis

## Tidyverse first: 

- Start from scratch with the dplyr package for manipulating a data frame, and introduce others like ggplot2, tidyr and purrr shortly afterwards. 

- Introduce the %>% operator from magrittr immediately, but skip syntax like [[]] and $ or leave them for late in the course. 

- Keep a single-minded focus on data frames.

- Don’t teach procedural logic (loops and conditionals), teach tables (group by and join)

- %>% isn’t too hard for beginners
