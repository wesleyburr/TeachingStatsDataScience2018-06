Randy Pruim's wisdom about R style:

- Always surround operators (+, *, /, etc.) with a SPACE.
Always follow a comma with a SPACE.
- Use SPACES or TABS to align your code nicely. (CMD-i will help with auto-indentation.)
- Keep your lines short (fewer than 80 characters wide); they should not spill off the page. Choose natural places for line breaks.
- Show both the code and the output. In particular, it is much easier for me to grade if I can see intermediate results, so show them.
- Try to be clear and consistent with your names for things.
